## Usage

Select both language of the container, enter anything in the text area, and then click translate. Switch language can be used of english of the left and french on the right, vice versa. Same as dropdown on the left and right. Note: If you select english of the left and dropdown on the right, it will not work. These template photos was aiming only for the english, french, and spanish. I decided to add more language into this project. 

## What I learn

This project was quite difficult, when I was about to start the project, I looked at the image of it. I started have doubts of "can I truly build this?". It became more comfortable when I started to focus on doing the small things first, like the html, css, and JS. I know what to do on the buttons for I have gain alot of experience, but with the translate, it was very difficult. I got help with this feature, but I undertstand on how it works. Much improvement still needed, with the css and js. Still need to learn many syntax and how to use them. I will focused on quality projects over quantity, to gain much learning. Very fun project, I definitely want to do more difficult project, so I can take my time and learn from it.
